In this document, I will go over some general steps, on how to access the dark web safely and as anonymously as possible.
Keep in mind, that you can still be tracked down and you are responsible for all your actions.

## Operating system

Short answer: use Linux, they dont track you and there is little to no malware.

## Tor browser settings

Here we will discuss some general setting for Tor. Adjust to your liking.

### Search engines

Use DuckDuckGo, or better, the DuckDuckGo Onion version. __Never__ use Google, Bing or any other search engines that track you down. This would defeat the purpose of Tor.

### Privacy and security

Check the setting to delete all cookies when you close Tor (this should be enabled by default).
Also set Tor to never remeber history, as some sites can access it and create profiles based on its content.
For the same reason, don't store any bookmarks in Tor. Put them in an external file and copy them over when needed. This may seem complicated, but Tor is not your day-to-day browser in most cases anyways.
Set the security settings to `Saftest` and manually enbale javasript when needed. This way you can make sure that no malicious or privacy invading scripts can be executed on your machine. It also blocks crypto miners.

The whole idea, is that, everytime you start Tor, its like you have never been there.

## Using Tor

There are a few general rules when using Tor to ensure you are safe and private.

Cover your webcam, if you are using a laptop. There are many fishy sites, that try to spie on you using your webcam.
__Never__ run Tor in fullscreen mode. Websites can access your screen size and create profiles based on this information.
Use it at half size or just some random size in the middle of the screen. Tor is bad for media consumption anyways.

You don't necessarily need a VPN when accessing Tor. It may help, but it's up to you if you trust your VPN provider. The Tor network is already designed in a way to mask your real IP adress by routing you through its nodes. A VPN might just slow you down even more without giving you a real benefit.
